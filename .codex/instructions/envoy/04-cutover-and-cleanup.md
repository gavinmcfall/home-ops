# 04 â€“ Cutover, Monitoring, and Cleanup

> **IaC-only reminder:** Execute removals, suspensions, and configuration changes through Git/Flux. Kubectl is reserved for validation and monitoring checks.

## Pre-Cutover Checklist
- All critical routes migrated and tested via Envoy.
- External-DNS confirms desired records pointing to Envoy IPs.
- Prometheus scraping Envoy metrics; dashboards updated.
- Runbook updated for new Gateway API workflows.

## Cutover Actions
1. **Final Load Tests**
   - Perform smoke tests for representative workflows (auth flows, uploads, S3 operations, Syncthing UI, etc.).
   - Monitor Envoy/HPA behaviour under typical load.

2. **Disable ingress-nginx**
   - Scale deployments to zero or suspend HelmRelease (Flux `suspend` command) as an initial safety measure.
   - Observe for traffic failures; roll back quickly if issues surface.
   - Once satisfied, remove ingress-nginx HelmReleases and associated ConfigMaps/Secrets (excluding certificates still in use).

3. **External-DNS Arguments**
   - Remove `--source=ingress` once no Ingress resources remain.
   - Clean up nginx-specific annotations from Services/Secrets.

4. **Certificate Management**
   - Confirm all TLS secrets referenced by HTTPRoutes remain valid (wildcard cert or per-app secrets).
   - Retire any nginx-specific secrets (e.g., default certs) if unused.

5. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Update alert rules to target Envoy metrics (error rates, 4xx/5xx, HPA saturation).
   - Remove nginx dashboards/alerts.

## Post-Migration Tasks
- Document lessons learned and update onboarding docs for Gateway usage.
- Provide templates/examples for new services to adopt HTTPRoute pattern by default.
- Periodically audit for leftover Ingress resources or annotations drifting back into manifests.
- Consider enabling advanced Envoy features (JWT auth, rate limiting, WAF) once baseline stabilises.
